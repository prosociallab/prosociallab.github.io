            We developed a tool that allows you to translate any academic papers into a card-based resource that can help with your design problems. This tool attemps to help make scholarly research more accessible, and is inspired by the growing set of card-based design tools, or <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/publications/hsieh-CHI2023-designcards.pdf' | relative_url }}">design cards</a>. Our <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/publications/shin-CHI2024-paper2card.pdf' | relative_url }}">paper</a> was published at the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</a>.
