  - title: "Behavior change design sprints (BCDS)"
    contributors : "Lucas Colusso, Gary Hsieh"
    description: "While numerous design methods used in industry help designers rapidly brainstorm design ideas, few help them to use theory in the design process. Behavior change theories can support such design activities as understanding, ideating, sketching, and prototyping. We present the Behavior Change Design Sprint (BCDS), a design process for applying behavior change theories to the design process and for prototyping behavior change technologies."

  - title: "Heuristic evaluation of conversational interfaces (& chatbots)"
    contributors : "Raina Langevin, Gary Hsieh"
    description: "Conversational interfaces have risen in popularity as businesses and users adopt a range of conversational agents, including chatbots and voice assistants. Although guidelines have been proposed, there is not yet an established set of usability heuristics to guide and evaluate conversational agent design. We present 11 validated heuristics for evaluating these conversational user interfaces."

  - title: "Paper 2 Card: Translating academic insights into design cards"
    contributors : "Donghoon Shin, Gary Hsieh"
    description: "Academic papers are hard to read. But they often contain valuable insights that can help with many aspects of design. Harnessing the power of generative AI, we developed a tool that can help designers take any academic paper and translate it into more usable/understandable content in the form of design cards."
